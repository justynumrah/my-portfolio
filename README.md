# My Portfolio Website

This is a personal portfolio website built using **ExpressJS**, **EJS**, and **Bootstrap**. It showcases my skills, sample projects, and contact information in a clean, responsive layout.

## Technologies Used

- **ExpressJS** – Handles routing and server-side logic
- **EJS** – Renders dynamic views with reusable partials
- **Bootstrap** – Provides responsive styling and layout
- **Node.js** – Powers the backend environment

## Pages Included

- **Home** – Intro and welcome message
- **About** – Personal background and skills
- **Projects** – Sample projects with descriptions
- **Contact** – Contact form and social links

## Features

- Modular routing with Express
- Dynamic EJS templates with partials (`header`, `footer`)
- Responsive design using Bootstrap grid and components
- Error handling for 404 and server errors
- Clear code comments for beginner readability

## Deployment

This site is deployed using **Render** for cloud hosting.  
**Live Site**: [coming soon ](https://comingsoon)
